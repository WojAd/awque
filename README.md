# awque
Double-ended queue

Double ended queue inspired by deque and made as class work

methods and declaration work similiar to those declared in deque. awque never throws an out_of_range exceptions. It just stops the method.

use push_at(n) to push a variable into n position.
use pop_at(n) to pop a variable from n position.

The class is free to use under attached license
